        <h2>CLI Usage</h2>
        <h3>Name</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>quick-lint-js - fund bugs in JavaScript programs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                quick-lint-js [--output-format=format] [&lt;options&gt;] file [file...]
            </li>
            <li>
                quick-lint-js --lsp-server [&lt;options&gt;]
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>quick-lint-js reads JavaScript files and reports syntax errors and other bugs.</li>
            <br /> This Command has two modes:
            <ul>
                <li>quick-lint-js [&lt;options&gt;] file [file...] Batch mode (default). Check the given files, and report errors to the terminal (standard error). --output-format can be used to customize how errors look.
                </li>
                <li>
                    quick-lint-js --lsp-server LSP server mode. Start a Language Server Protocol server, communicating using stan‐ dard input and standard output. Use this mode to integrate with code editors sup‐ porting LSP.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Options</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>--output-format=format Customize how errors are printed. format is one of the following: - gnu-like (default): a human-readable format similar to GCC. - vim-qflist-json: machine-readable JSON which can be given to Vim's setqflist func‐ tion.
                Incompatible with --lsp-server.</li>
            <li>--vim-file-bufnr=number Set the bufnr property for errors printed with the --output-format=vim-qflist-json option. --vim-file-bufnr applies only to files which are given later in the command line. Therefore, if multiple files are given, --vim-file-bufnr
                can be specified multiple times.</li>
            <li>--exit-fail-on=errors Cause quick-lint-js to exit with a non-zero exit code if any of the discovered er‐ rors is listed in errors. See the "ERROR LISTS" section for a description of the format for errors. Incompatible with --lsp-server.</li>
            <li>--lsp, --lsp-server Run quick-lint-js in LSP server mode. Use this mode to integrate with code editors supporting LSP. An editor can send LSP requests and notifications to quick-lint-js via standard input, and receive LSP responses and notifications
                from standard out‐ put. Incompatible with --output-format.</li>
            <li>-h, --help Print a help message and exit. The output format is not intended to be machine-parsable and may change in the fu‐ ture.</li>
            <li>
                -v, --version Print version information and exit. The output format is not intended to be machine-parsable and may change in the fu‐ ture.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Error Lists</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Some options, such as --exit-fail-on, accept an error list. An error list is a comma-sepa‐ rated list of error code predicates and error category predicates. An error lists can contain any number of include, exclude, and default predicates. An in‐ clude
                predicate is a '+' followed by the name of an error code or error category. An ex‐ clude predicate is a '-' followed by the name of an error code or error category. An de‐ fault predicate is the name of an error code or error category
                with no sigil. An error list containing only include and exclude predicates modifies a default set of er‐ ror codes. The default set is decided by the option, but is often the set of all error codes. An error list containing at least one
                default predicate empties the set of error codes, then treats the default predicates as if they were include predicates. The order of predicates within an error list does not matter. Included predicates are pro‐ cessed first, adding to
                the set of error codes. Excluded predicates are processed second, removing from the set of error codes. Error codes have the form E000, where 000 is three decimal digits (0-9). The following error categories are supported: all All error
                codes. Example error lists: E102,E110 Only error codes E102 and E110, excluding all other error codes. -E102 The default set of error codes, except for error code E102. +E102 The default set of error codes, and also error code E102. all,-E102
                All error codes, except for error code E102. E100,-E100,+E200 Only error code E200, excluding all other error codes. +E200,-E100,E100 Only error code E200, excluding all other error codes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exit Status</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                0 Batch mode: Linting succeeded with no errors or warnings. LSP server mode: The LSP client requested that the server shut down. This exit sta‐ tus may change in the future. non-0 Batch mode: Linting failed with at least one error or warning, or at least
                one file could not be opened and read. The specific status code may change in the future.
            </li>
        </ul>
